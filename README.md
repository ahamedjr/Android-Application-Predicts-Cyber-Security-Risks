## 📥 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android device running Android 6.0 or higher
- Android Studio (for development)
- JDK 11 or higher

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyberrisk-predictor.git
   cd cyberrisk-predictor
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder

3. **Build the project**
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```

4. **Run on device/emulator**
   - Connect your Android device or start an emulator
   - Click "Run" or press Shift + F10

### Install APK (End Users)

Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/cyberrisk-predictor/releases) page and install on your Android device.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Launch the App** - Open CyberRisk Predictor on your device
2. **Grant Permissions** - Allow necessary permissions for security analysis
3. **Run Security Scan** - Tap "Scan Device" to initiate risk assessment
4. **Review Results** - Examine the risk score and identified vulnerabilities
5. **Follow Recommendations** - Implement suggested security improvements
6. **Monitor Trends** - Track your security posture over time

### Sample Risk Factors Analyzed

- App permissions and behaviors
- Network security status
- Device encryption status
- Screen lock configuration
- Unknown sources settings
- Developer options status
- Outdated software versions

## 🔧 How It Works

The app uses a multi-layered approach to predict cybersecurity risks:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers security-relevant information from device settings and configurations
2. **Risk Analysis**: Applies algorithms to evaluate each security parameter
3. **Threat Prediction**: Uses pattern recognition to identify potential vulnerabilities
4. **Scoring Algorithm**: Calculates overall risk score based on weighted factors
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Generates personalized security improvement suggestions

```
[Optional: Add a flowchart or architecture diagram]
```

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- ✅ **No Data Collection**: All analysis happens locally on your device
- ✅ **No External Transmission**: Risk data never leaves your device
- ✅ **Open Source**: Full transparency - review the code yourself
- ✅ **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests permissions necessary for security analysis
- ✅ **No Ads or Tracking**: Your privacy is paramount
